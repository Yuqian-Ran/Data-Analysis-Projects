# Data-Analysis-Projects
Two data analysis projects  
1.	Titanic Data Analysis Project  
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. We analyze the train dataset and answer 5 questions.  
2.	Stock Market Analysis Project  
In this project we will be looking at data from the “Apple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon” stock market over the past year. We will use pandas to get stock information, visualize different aspects of it, and finally we will look at a few ways of analyzing the risk of a stock, based on its previous performance history. We will also be predicting future stock prices through a Monte Carlo method.
